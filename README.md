# React Native - Guess The Number

Demo application to learn React Native and its components, plus using Dimensions and Platform for better control of how each component is rendered depending on the device.

In this app, the user chooses a number and the phone will try to guess it. The user should then tell the phone if the chosen number is smaller or bigger than the guessed one. Each attempt is tracked and shown in a list. Finally, when the phone guesses the right number, the app shows how many tries it took.
